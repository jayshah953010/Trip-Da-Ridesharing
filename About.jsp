<h3>About Tripda</h3>
<hr>
<h3>The Tripda Ride</h3>
<p>We believe that a world in which people are connected is much more fun! More than that, we need to connect in order to meet new people and explore new places. Tripda is a marketplace that connects people who need a ride to drivers who have empty seats in their cars. This enables people to meet new people and save money by sharing their travel costs, ultimately helping people to travel more while spending less! With fewer cars on the roads, we help not only people, but also the environment, as fewer cars means less carbon-emissions released into our atmosphere. The Tripda Ride is the smart way to roll, for your budget and the planet.</p>
<h3>Why is Tripda so awesome?</h3>
<h4>It's a cheap way to travel!</h4>
<p>Tripda helps people share their costs instead of helping drivers make a profit, and the rides you take with Tripda are way more fun than other means of transportation, not to mention the comfort of a car and the fun of having company throughout the whole trip! Besides, the use of our service is completely FREE!</p>
